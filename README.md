# Ds_Project
The code files for this project are:
1.Commodity.java
2.CommodityDriverMaster.java
3.Driver.java
4.unspsc codes_3-1.csv

In this project, We are implementing Arraylist, Linkedlist,Stack,Queues,Hashtable and are using some built-in methods present in Collection package. 
First we add the elements using add method in for loop.
Secondly we are sorting them using Collections.sort(Parameter) method. 
And lastly we are using contains, remove and max methods of Collection package on arrayListCommodities, linkedListCommodities,stackCommodities, queueCommodities and tableCommodities and printing them using print method.
We have used these methods in code that is present in Driver.java file. 
To use this code, after downloading these files you have to set path of unspsc codes_3-1.csv file in CommodityDriverMaster.java and Driver.java files using the actual path of folder in your computer after downloading. This will help to access csv file that contains data on which we are working. If you will not set the path of this csv file then you will get "file not found" exception. So make sure to set this path in files to correctly use this code.
